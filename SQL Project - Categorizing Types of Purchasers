<h1>SQL Project - Categorizing Types of Purchasers</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
The project involves leveraging SQLite to analyze an online music store's database and classify customers based on their purchase behavior. Customers will be categorized into different segments depending on the amount they spend on music purchases. Specifically, customers spending $0.99 to $1.99 will be classified as Baseline Purchasers, those spending $2.00 to $6.99 as Low Purchasers, those spending $7.00 to $15.00 as Target Purchasers (the primary focus of this project), and customers spending above $15.00 as Top Purchasers. Throughout this project, you will encounter the use of CASE statements and the creation of aliases to manipulate the data and identify customers within specified spending ranges.
